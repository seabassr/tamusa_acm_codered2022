      <p>This information takes a slight different approch that is looking at actual oil production in the United
        States. Here we are exploring the correlation between oil production and the Unite States CPI. We are able to
        determine that as oil production increased so does consumer confidence with the opposite being correct as
        well. We are also able to determine that consumer confidence is also impacted while slighlty to the average
        gas price. </p>
